# Some notes:
This project was built as more of an exercise to mimic the Wordle interface, not as a substitute to the game. As such certain functionality is omitted:
saving game stats in local storage,
loading a dictionary to generate / check the existance of words.

Currently the word of the day is hardcoded (WORDL)
To come: A write up of things that I learned during this project, as well as why/how I made certain techincal descisions.
